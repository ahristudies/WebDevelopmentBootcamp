Does everyone think of the Internet as something super complex, maybe a satellite? Or a cloud that distributes the Internet around, but it's basically a long wire that connects different computers to each other. There are two types of computers, the one we normally use to access websites, respond to emails and this one is called a client and the other is a machine that is connected 24/7 to respond to requests, exchange data and files, these are called of servers. Companies that offer a service on the Internet can have their own server, for example: Google, Facebook, Twitter and etc…, while small companies usually pay for hosting (hiring a smaller server so that their website is online). So in practice, how does accessing a website work?

You type “google.com” → Your browser sends a message to your ISP → This message is redirected to DNS → The DNS response is sent to your browser, the response is usually the IP number of this site → Your request goes to the backbone → the backbone connects you with the server referring to that IP → The server sends you several files that help you to visualize this site.

DNS: Acronym for Domain Name Service, it's a big phone book on the Internet, just like your cell phone has a directory that associates a name with a number, it's the same thing as DNS. A URL (name of your website) connects you with the IP (number of the server where the website is), every computer has an IP.

Backbone: It is a service that connects the network between countries using submarine cables. For example, you are in Brazil and you connect to a website that is on a server in London, after your request goes through the internet operator, the backbone will make the “travel” of your request to London.

IP: Acronym for Internet Protocol, it is the number that identifies your computer to the network. It is through it that we receive and send data on the Internet.

URL: Abbreviation for Uniform Resource Locator, it means the address of the website. It is used in the browser text bar, each part of it has a meaning, for example: [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

HTTP: It is the protocol used to bring more security to the user's navigation, currently most sites work with the most secure version, which is HTTPS, which brings encryption to the page.

WWW: It is no longer necessary to type these days, but it means that first your site is on the World Wide Web and also in the old days it was used as a protocol so that your browser could read hypertext links

GOOGLE: Here we're using google as an example, but it doesn't really matter what the name is (as long as it's correct, for example typing [facebook](http://facebook.co).com takes me to the facebook website, but [fashirbuq.c](http://fashirbuq.cm)om is going to be a non-existing site, or it could be… The internet is weird sometimes).

.COM: It is a top-level domain (TLD), first created for the purpose of identifying commercial sites on the Internet. However, with its popularization, it is no longer something exclusive for commerce and has become the most used TLD on the Internet, this extension classifies what that site is about, there are others such as .edu for educational purposes, .gov for government sites - or customized as .au (Australian sites) or .br (Brazilian sites).
