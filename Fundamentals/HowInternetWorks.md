 Contrary to what many think, the Internet is not an alien force that appeared out of nowhere and functions as a spiritual energy that commands the world. The internet is basically a network that connects the whole world by cables, and its function is to connect people and information.

These cables that connect countries are undersea and taken care of by backbone services. If you view a map of submarine cables, you will see white dots at the ends which are where the network enters and exits. Within countries, this connection still continues via cable, but it is already visible to people, it is the cables that are on the poles, maybe there is one on your street.

So what is the most basic way to have internet in your home? You hire an ISP service, which goes to your house and connects a cable to the nearest cell tower. And in your house, do you have a device that distributes the network in your house, via wi-fi perhaps?

So, whenever you connect to a website or something, that request goes from the computer to the router, which goes to the tower and goes to the internet provider and so it goes to the submarine cables until it reaches the website server.
